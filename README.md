### 🌿 Package Manager & Lockfile

This starter project uses **[`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)** for fast, reliable installs and fully reproducible builds.
You are welcome to use `npm` or `yarn` instead — simply remove the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and reinstall with your preferred tool.

```bash
# To install with pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# Or with npm
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
npm install

# Or with yarn
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
yarn install
```

> 🕊️ The lockfile is included intentionally to ensure harmony across environments.
> Keeping it preserves the exact versions used to build this sacred starting point.
